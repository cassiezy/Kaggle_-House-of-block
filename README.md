# Kaggle House of block

#### This project is one of the assignments for [T81-558: Applications of Deep Neural Netw1orks](https://sites.wustl.edu/jeffheaton/t81-558/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://www.wustl.edu). See more detail at [Kaggle In-Class House of Blocks Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/applications-of-deep-learning-wustl-fall-2020) 
#### The data set is made up of many different buildings, built from a simulated set of wooden building blocks. The task is to predict the structural stability of block buildings. See example of block building below:
